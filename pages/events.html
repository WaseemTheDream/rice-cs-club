      <h3>Hackathons</h3>
      <p>Rice CS Club hosts a yearly student-led hackathon named <a href="{{ hack_rice.link }}">HackRice</a>. During the hackathon people get together and collaboratively code in an extreme manner over the span of a day or two to build amazing projects!</p>
      <p>It's simple: Code, Eat, Sleep for the entire weekend and see what you come up with. We'll take care of the eating part.</p>
      <p>At the end of the hackathon, participants demonstrate their applications to the audience and a panel of judges for a chance to win prizes.</p>
