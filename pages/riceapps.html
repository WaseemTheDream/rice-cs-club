      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        As students, we often see room for improvement in daily college life processes. Many of these improvements can be made through software projects that serve as powerful tools. This initiative aims to provide the program and resources for students to create and improve open-source projects at Rice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to produce multiple projects each year, which can be maintained and improved by future generations of Rice Apps developers.
      </p>
      <h3>Pilot Program</h3>
      <p>
        We are currently starting a pilot program for the Fall 2013 semester. We aim to complete two projects with small teams before Thanksgiving.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently looking for people to join us. Applications are open for a short time and we will accept people rapidly on a rolling basis. If you are interested in joining, please apply as soon as possible! Unfortunately, due to the experimental nature of the program right now, we will only be able to accept a very small number of applicants.

          What kind of skills and background are you looking for?
        </h5>
        <p>
        There are no strict requirements or prerequisites, but applicants should be passionate about the mission of Rice Apps, be technically proficient and creative, and have strong communication skills.

          What’s in it for me?
        </h5>
        <p>
        The success of the program depends on active collaboration with low communication overhead. We will meet once a week for roughly a 4 hour time period to work on the projects. Some tasks may need to be completed outside of contact hours. Caffeine and snacks will be provided during hacking time!
