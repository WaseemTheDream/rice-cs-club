      <h3>Social Events</h3>
      <p>Throughout the year, we hold social events such as lunches, study breaks, mixers, bowling nights, and random outings. We regularly host a study break or Christmas party after classes end. In the past study breaks, we have had activities such as cookie decorating contest, gift exchange, video games, trivia, prizes and swag giveaways. We also host a movie night once a semester.</p>

      <h3>Hackathons</h3>
      <p>Rice CS Club hosts a yearly student-led hackathon named <a href="http://hack.rice.edu">Hack Rice</a>. During the hackathon people get together and collaboratively code in an extreme manner over the span of a day or two to build amazing projects!</p>
      <p>It's simple: Code, Eat, Sleep for the entire weekend and see what you come up with. We'll take care of the eating part.</p>
      <p>At the end of the hackathon, participants demonstrate their applications to the audience and a panel of judges for a chance to win prizes.</p>
