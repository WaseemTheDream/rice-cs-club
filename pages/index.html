    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>The Rice University Computer Science Club is an organization dedicated to providing Rice students with an informational and social network of individuals interested in computer science. We provide professional resources, including resume review sessions, interview preparation, and weekly lunch talks by Rice faculty and industry insiders. We also foster community among computer science students by way of club-hosted study breaks, random outings, and social lunches.</p>
